# Preface

The chapter titles in these notes correspond with the chapter titles
in the book
[*Numerical Linear Algebra*](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/text.html)
by Trefethen and Bau, published by SIAM.  The sections below are
labeled "Lectures" because the chapters in the book are labeled
"Lectures", but they may not correspond with single class periods.

<div class="html">A nicely typeset version of these notes is
[here](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/applied-linear-algebra.pdf).</div>

An online version of these notes is available that includes some
enhancements from [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org).

**Make sure to read and understand each chapter as we cover it in class.**
