# Preface

The chapter titles in these notes correspond with the chapter titles
in the book
[*Numerical Linear Algebra*](http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/text.html)
by Trefethen and Bau, published by SIAM.  The sections below are
labeled "Lectures" because the chapters in the book are labeled
"Lectures", but they may not correspond with single class periods.
